# What's this?
This repository contains a series of articles (you could call them "blogposts" as well) explaining the basics of software development.

In my vocabulary, sofware development differs from computer science or from programming. Let's explain the nuance by defining what I mean when I talk about people in these respective fields:
* Programmer: someone who programs a computer.
* Computer scientist: someone who writes algorithms.
* Software developer: someone who creates software.

Of course, these definitions are extremely simplistic. But they do convey my point:
* You can be a programmer without being a software developer.
* You can be a computer scientist without being a software developer. 
* You can NOT be a software developer without also being a programmer; and
* In some areas of software development, you cannot be a good software developer without also being a computer scientist.
