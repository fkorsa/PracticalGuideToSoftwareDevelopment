An Integrated Development Environment or IDE is a tool that helps you on various aspects of the software development process: editing, debugging, versioning... It differs from a plain text editor by the rich features it offers, usually targeted at a specific programming language. One IDE can support several different languages, but it's never *the* best one for all. That's why you should not hesitate to try a different than what you are uses to when switching languages, even if the one you already use has support for that language.
